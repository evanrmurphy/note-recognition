# Note recognition #

## THIS CODE HAS A NEW HOME ##

I rewrote this app so that I could more easily introduce new features and so that it more seamlessly integrates with the product that it was built for, [SightReadingMastery](https://sightreadingmastery.com/).

The app is alive and well at [sightreadingmastery.com/note-recognition](https://sightreadingmastery.com/note-recognition). However, the new code can unfortunately not be open sourced (at least not yet).
