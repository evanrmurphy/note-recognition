Learn to Sight Read Music — One Note at a Time

## :warning: The Code for this app no longer lives here ##

Hi, thanks for checking out my webapp for learning the notes of the musical staff.

I rewrote this app so that I could more easily introduce new features and so that it more seamlessly integrates with the product that it was built for, [SightReadingMastery](https://sightreadingmastery.com/).

[The app is alive and well](https://sightreadingmastery.com/note-recognition) and you're welcome to use it. However, the new code unfortunately cannot be open sourced (at least not yet).
